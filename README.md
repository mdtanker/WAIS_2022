## Abstract

The bedrock geology beneath Antarctica's southern Ross Embayment is concealed by 100–
1000s of meters of sedimentary deposits, seawater, and the floating Ross Ice Shelf (RIS). Our
research strips away those layers to discover the shape of the consolidated bedrock below,
which we refer to as the basement. To do this, we use the contrast between non-magnetic
sediments and magnetic basement rocks to map out the depth of the basement surface under
the RIS. Our primary data source is ROSETTA-Ice airborne measurements of the variation in
Earth's magnetic field across the ice shelf, from flight lines spaced 10-km apart. We use the
resulting basement topography to highlight sites of possible influence upon the Antarctic Ice
Sheet and to further understand the tectonic history of the region. The basement features we
image are characteristic of extensional tectonics, consistent with the setting in the West
Antarctic Rift System. These features show continuity with Ross Sea basement features,
suggesting a common tectonic development. In the center of the ice shelf, we delineate a broad,
segmented, N-S basement high with thin (0–500m) sedimentary cover. We discover contrasting
basement characteristics on either side of the RIS. The West Antarctic side displays evidence of
active faults, which may localize geothermal heat, accommodate movements of the solid earth
caused by changes in the size of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and control the flow of groundwater
between the ice base and aquifers. The East Antarctic side contains a wide and deep basin,
with sediments over 3 km thick. This work contributes critical information about Ross
Embayment basement topography and subglacial boundary conditions that arise from an
interplay of geology, tectonics, and glaciation.
